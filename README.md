# Falling Balls
OOP Based Java Project

*Description*

This project is OOP based and stdlib library is used. Balls and created platforms were created as two separate subclasses. The properties of the balls and the properties of the platforms can be adjusted through these classes. Positioning of the platform on the map is obtained with a file in txt format that is read from the outside. Only the location of the platform can change according to the file content. The drop of the balls proceeds vertically as long as there is no collision - that is, unless an object is detected in the next step. The ball that encounters a platform stops hitting the platform. The balls do not rest on top of each other, they can intertwine after collision. The spawn of balls is completely random.
